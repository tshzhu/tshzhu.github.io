I am Tansheng Zhu (pronounced "Tahn-shung Joo" • \/ˈtɑːn.ʃʌŋ ˈdʒuː\/), a first-year Ph.D. student at [https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences], [https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm Tsinghua University]. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Prof. [https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianli/ Jian Li]. Before that, I studied as an undergraduate at [https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/ Zhiyuan College], [https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/ Shanghai Jiao Tong University], majoring in mathematics with a minor in finance.

At Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I am honored to pursue my undergraduate thesis research under the mentorship of Prof. [https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xuzl/ Zhenli Xu].
During my exchange at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, I was fortunate to join Prof. [https://fengleifan.github.io/Feng-Lei.Fan.github.io/about.html Fenglei Fan]'s research group and continued as a summer research intern.
~~~

My current research interests lie in *machine learning theory*, with a focus on understanding deep learning from training processes, scaling behaviors, generalization and application, and also the interpretability of large language models.
