== About me
I am Tansheng Zhu (pronounced as Tahn-Shung--Joo), a first-year Ph.D. student at the [https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)], [https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm Tsinghua University]. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Prof. [https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianli/ Jian Li]. 
Prior to this, I received my B.S. degree from [https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/Default/index/ School of Mathematical Sciences] and [https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/ Zhiyuan College], [https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/ Shanghai Jiao Tong University]. There, I had the honor of conducting my undergraduate thesis research under the mentorship of Prof. [https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xuzl/ Zhenli Xu].
During an exchange at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, I was fortunate to join Prof. [https://fengleifan.github.io/Feng-Lei.Fan.github.io/about.html Fenglei Fan]'s lab and served as a research intern.

My current research interests lie in *machine learning theory*, with a focus on understanding deep learning from training processes, scaling behaviors and generalization, as well as the interpretability of large language models.
