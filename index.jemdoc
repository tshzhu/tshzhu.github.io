I am a final-year undergraduate at [https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/ Zhiyuan College], [https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/ Shanghai Jiao Tong University], majoring in mathematics with a minor in finance. 
In Fall 2025, I will join the [https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences] at [https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm Tsinghua University] as a Ph.D. student, advised by Prof. [https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianli/ Jian Li].


At Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I am honored to pursue my undergraduate thesis research under the mentorship of Prof. [https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xuzl/ Zhenli Xu].
During my exchange at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, I was fortunate to join Prof. [https://fengleifan.github.io/Feng-Lei.Fan.github.io/about.html Fenglei Fan]'s research group as an intern and continued as a research assistant in the following summer.
~~~

My research interests lie in~~{{<span style="font-family: monospace, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">{machine learning theory, optimization, and high-dimensional probability}</span>}}.

Under the guidance of Prof. Zhenli Xu, I am currently researching efficient algorithms for Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning. 
Also, under the supervision of Prof. Fenglei Fan, I am investigating the properties of finitely wide neural networks as their depth approaches infinity, with the aim of uncovering the duality between width and depth.
